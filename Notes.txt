In the middle of adding new collections:
-stop old publish before creating new one
-see what DOM elements need to be deleted by hand (if any) (check tooltips)
-test that new and edited nodes and links end up in the right graph
-get select, new and delete callbacks working and notifying
-get the title and fonts to all look good
-may be: allow renaming and duplicating graphs?
saving and backup:
-save json text file for the currGraph on the server (dated) with one click
