ToDo:
+fix gravity
+Link style changing on type change - immediate
+resize tooltips
+Ctrl + [+/-] - resize nodes
+Ctrl + O / R - orient link
+Ctrl + U/D - change type
+Select node/link on creation 
+Make example links oriented by default
+Set default link weight based on node importance
Default links to oriented in general(?)
Make "related" links easier to catch
Small nodes force away from center??
orienting links shouldn't change their length (currently makes them longer)
add Link repulsion? (link-node repulsion?)
"related" links weaker than theorems

overall styling
images support
nodes fixing?
zoom behavior (show/hide nodes)

Not ToDo:
node size adjust with Ctrl-zoom: non-integer size values are confusing (can fix), updating DB is confusing (at force.end), need to disable zoom behavior (not sure how)




Launching online:
(already good now) - remove the local mrt:mathjax and MathJax installations - let it use latest MathJax code directly from their server.

Tooltips pros/cons:
			pro				con
-meteor lookback	simple, mathjax			only 1, not smooth
-SVG text		smooth move/zoom		no mathjax, must resize
-foreign div		mathjax, easy styling		must update

pros: Creating new collection ----v---- name labels in one collection
clean and complete seperation
if anything goes wrong, delete coll
faster publish
					meteor-friendly
					easy to combine trees

Marketing:--------------
-a generalization of books (books are a special case of this - with linear tree)
